      <p>
        I am passionate about digital projects with a social impact. For several
        years, I have worked as a Product Owner on softwares aimed at supporting
        NGOs. I then decided to become a web developer and embarked on an
        intensive web development bootcamp. My technology skillset includes Ruby
        on Rails, Javascript, React.JS, HTML and CSS.
